# Definition of Done (DoD) - EcoMarineWay

A backlog item is considered **Done** when the following criteria are met:

- Code is written, committed, and pushed to the repository  
- Code is reviewed and approved by at least one teammate  
- Feature works as expected and passes manual/automated tests  
- No high/critical bugs remain open  
- Integrated into the main branch without breaking existing features  
- Documentation (if needed) is updated  

This ensures consistency, quality, and shared understanding across the team.
