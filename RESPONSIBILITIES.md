# EcoMarineWay: Team Roles & Sprint Responsibilities

**Members:** Sasmitha, Isara, Dinithi, Olivia

**Purpose:**
This document defines clear, simple responsibilities for each team member across Sprint 0 + 4 development sprints (bi-weekly sprints). It keeps accountability clear while allowing role rotation for the Product Owner (PO) and Scrum Master (SM).

---

## üß© Team Roles (overview)

* **Product Owner (PO)** ‚Äì owns product vision, prioritizes backlog, and manages stakeholder feedback.
* **Scrum Master (SM)** ‚Äì runs Scrum events, removes blockers, and keeps the team on process.
* **Full‚ÄëStack Developer (Dev)** ‚Äì implements features, writes tests, and helps with deployment.

> Note: Only two members are hands-on developers in each sprint, but everyone helps with testing, documentation and demos.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (DoD) (team-wide)

A backlog item is Done when:

* Code is peer-reviewed and merged to main (or merge branch)
* Unit and integration tests pass or test plan documented
* Feature is responsive and accessible
* Feature is deployed to staging for QA
* Documentation (README or wiki) updated with usage notes

---

## üîÅ Role Rotation & Handover

* PO and SM rotate across sprints as assigned above to share ownership and learning.
* At the end of each sprint the outgoing PO/SM writes a short **handover note** (1‚Äì2 bullets) in ClickUp to the incoming role covering: blockers, pending decisions, and open technical debts.

---

## üì£ Communication & Tools

* **Daily updates:** 15-minute standups on working days (3 days/week)
* **Primary tools:** ClickUp (tasks), GitHub (code), Slack/Discord (chat), Figma (wireframes)
* **Demo:** each sprint review includes a 5‚Äì10 minute demo + feedback capture in ClickUp

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Final notes

* Keep responsibilities light and focused for each two-week sprint.
* If a team member is blocked for more than a day, escalate to the SM immediately.
* Use MoSCoW priority: Must / Should / Could / Won't for quick backlog decisions.
